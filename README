Python interface to rmnlib using ctypes and wrapper dynamic library,
the wrapper .so library is created in the RPNc(also here at github) project.

The main class is in rpn.py, the level_kinds.py and data_types.py
contain constants and the other files are the examples of how I am using 
the RPN class.
